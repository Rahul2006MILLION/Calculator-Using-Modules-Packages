## ðŸ“œ Project Description:-

This project is a fully functional **command-line calculator** crafted with **modular programming principles** and organized into **Python packages and modules**.  
It is designed to not only perform basic arithmetic operations but also serve as a **learning reference** for anyone interested in structuring Python projects in a clean, professional way.  

The calculator is split into multiple **independent modules**, each handling a specific responsibility:  
- **`code.py`** âž¡ Core mathematical functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (with zero-division handling).  
- **`display.py`** âž¡ User interaction and menu selection loop.  
- **`welcome.py`** âž¡ Friendly welcome banner.  
- **`__init__.py`** âž¡ Package entry point for clean imports.
